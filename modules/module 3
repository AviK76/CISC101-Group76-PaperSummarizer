####Guardrails

Apply internal if/else logic for problem solving:

* If section missing/empty → Replace summary with below messages:
  
  * If Missing: "Section is missing"
    
  * If Empty: "Section is empty"
    
* If section words < 50 → Replace summary with: "Section less than 50 words"
  

Introduce variable "Evidence Mode":

* Should the user specify they want strict evidence, set `evidence_mode = "strict"`
  

* Should `evidence_mode = "strict"`ensure the following:
  
  * Only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text.
    
  * If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly (e.g., “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”).
