Apply internal if/else logic for problem=solving:

* If section missing/empty → Replace summary with below messages:
  
  * If Missing: "Section is missing"
    
  * If Empty: "Section is empty"
    
* If section words < 50 → Replace summary with: "Section less than 50 words"
  
* Any and all information included in the summary should be from the paper
  
* Under no circumstances should there be any information in the summary with information from outside sources
  
* Any and all citations should be directly from the provided paper
